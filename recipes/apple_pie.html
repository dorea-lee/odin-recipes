        <h4>For Pastry</h4>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>1 1/4 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>1/4 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1/2 cup unsalted butter, diced and then chilled</li>
            <li>1/4 cup ice cold water, or as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>For Filling</h4>
        <ul class="ingredients">
            <li>8 small Granny Smith apples, peeled and thinly sliced</li>
            <li>Butter and flour</li>
            <li>Sugar, White and Brown, as needed</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Steps</h3>
        <h4>Create the Pie Crust</h4>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>
                Combine salt and flour together before blending in chilled,
                diced butter until mixture resembles coarse crumbs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slowly add cold water to the mixture, mixing with a spatula
                until the dough comes together. You may need less than 1/4 cup
                of water.
            </li>
            <li>Leave the dough to chill for at least 4 hours or overnight.</li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Making the Filling</h4>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Melt butter over medium butter, do not let it clarify.</li>
            <li>
                Add flour and stir to form a paste, cook it until it is fragant,
                about 1-2 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>Add both sugars and water (as needed), bring to a boil.</li>
            <li>
                Once the mixture is boiling, reduce the heat to low and simmer
                for 3-5 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
        <h4>Putting it all together</h4>
        <ol class="steps">
            <li>Preheat the oven at 425 degrees F</li>
            <li>
                Take the dough out and roll out it out on a pie pan, ideally
                9-inch. Make sure that the pastry will overhang the pie by 1/2
                inch
            </li>
            <li>Cut the remaining pastry into 8, 1-inch strips.</li>
            <li>
                Place sliced apples into the bottom crust, forming a slight
                mound.
            </li>
            <li>
                Lay four pastry strips vertically and evenly spaced over apples,
                using longer strips in the center and shorter strips at the
                edges.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make a lattice crust: Fold the first and third strips all the
                way back so they're almost falling off the pie. Lay one of the
                unused strips perpendicularly over the second and fourth strips,
                then unfold the first and third strips back into their original
                position.
            </li>
            <li>
                Fold the second and fourth vertical strips back. Lay one of the
                three unused strips perpendicularly over top. Unfold the second
                and fourth strips back into their original position.
            </li>
            <li>
                Repeat Steps 6 and 7 to weave in the last two strips of pastry.
                Fold and trim excess dough at the edges as necessary, and pinch
                to secure.
            </li>
            <li>
                Slowly and gently pour sugar-butter mixture over lattice crust,
                making sure it seeps over sliced apples. Brush some onto
                lattice, but make sure it doesn't run off the sides.
            </li>
            <li>
                Bake in the preheated oven for 15 minutes. Reduce the
                temperature to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C) and continue baking
                until apples are soft, 35 to 45 minutes.
            </li>
        </ol>
